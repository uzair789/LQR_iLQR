    Parameters
    ----------
    env: gym.core.Env
      The environment you are try to control. In this homework the 2
      link arm.
    x: np.array
      The state to test. When approximating A you will need to perturb
      this.
    u: np.array
      The command to test. When approximating B you will need to
      perturb this.
    dt: float, optional
      The time step to simulate. In general the smaller the time step
      the more accurate the gradient approximation.

    Returns
    -------
    xdot: np.array
      This is the **CHANGE** in x. i.e. (x[1] - x[0]) / dt
      If you return x you will need to solve a different equation in
